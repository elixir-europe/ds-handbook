## Context
The way in which research data management (RDM) information flows within an organisation and how staff can interact with it plays a central role in the maturity of RDM support. Effective RDM depends not only on the availability of policies, tools, and guidelines, but also on how they are communicated and whether researchers can engage with them meaningfully.

Many institutions still rely on top-down, one-directional messaging: guidelines are issued but rarely discussed, questioned, or adapted based on actual feedback. Without structures for interaction, staff struggle to raise concerns, propose improvements, or access timely support. This weakens uptake, erodes trust, and disconnects RDM services from real-world practice.

Responsiveness is a signal of institutional commitment. When RDM teams are visible, trusted, and resourced to answer questions and track feedback, it reflects leadership’s investment in dialogue and continuous improvement. Conversely, delays or silence often point to structural gaps: understaffing, low awareness, or minimal buy-in.

Insights from ELIXIR Node self-assessments reveal a spectrum of practice – from ad hoc or opaque channels to strong feedback loops with helpdesks, open office hours, or community formats like RDM breakfasts. Institutions that enable two-way communication demonstrate that they value not just information delivery, but the relationships and responsiveness that underpin effective research data management.

## Guidelines
The following tips support data stewards and their institutions in progressing along the maturity indicator for communication and responsiveness. They are organised around five core areas: visibility, accessibility, feedback, responsiveness, and institutional integration, aligned with Node experiences and established support models.

### Make RDM support visible and findable

1. Use a consistent support identity
Create a functional email address (e.g. rdm-support@...) and use it for all communication to ensure clarity and continuity.
2. Increase presence in the institutional landscape
Promote support roles in:
* Onboarding materials and welcome emails
* Newsletters or intranet pages
* Hallway posters or slides at department meetings

### Offer clear and reliable communication channels

1. Provide structured points of contact
Establish predictable channels for support, such as helpdesks, shared inboxes, or advertised drop-in hours.
2. Go where the researchers are
Join regular activities to stay visible and build trust:
* Lab meetings
* Working groups
* Orientation events

### Encourage and normalise feedback

1. Invite questions proactively
Include feedback prompts in emails, presentations, or onboarding slides to make asking questions feel normal.
2. Track what comes in
Use a simple format to log input and improve consistency over time, such as a shared spreadsheet or form.
3. Dedicate time to follow up
Set aside hours specifically for responding to questions and reflecting on service quality.

### Demonstrate that feedback leads to improvement

1. Communicate visible change
Let researchers know when their input results in updates to templates, guidance, or policies. 
2. Use patterns to strengthen support
Recurring questions can highlight unclear guidance or missing resources. Use them to guide improvements.
3. Share back through existing channels
Update your community via:
* Internal newsletters or “RDM tip” sections
* Team briefings or training events

### Embed RDM communication into institutional workflows

1. Position support at key moments
Align contact points with research milestones such as project registration, data deposit, or ethics review.
2. Participate in cross-functional structures
Ensure communication roles are represented in:
* Grant writing teams
* Infrastructure planning groups
* Research governance meetings
