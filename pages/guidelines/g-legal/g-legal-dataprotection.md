## Context
[Collins dictionary](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/legal-framework#google_vignette) defines legal framework as “a particular set of rules, ideas, or beliefs which you use in order to deal with problems or to decide what to do”. In the context of data stewardship and research data management, this topic covers all agreements and contracts regarding research data. 

However, it also encompasses all the laws, regulations, and institutional policies that govern how research data is handled throughout the research project. This includes crucial areas like data protection (e.g., GDPR), intellectual property, data sharing protocols, and ethical considerations. Although IT security, GDPR and ethics are their own topics in this handbook, this topic will briefly cover these since they all fall under the general legal framework. 

The level of engagement of data stewards varies, and it is often one of offering consultation to legal officers and data protection officers (DPOs) at their respective institutions or support to researchers and other actors who generate or work with data. If your organisation is small, it might not have a legal department, which puts an additional strain on the data steward to seek out legal support and develop a level of understanding of the legal context. According to the report by the [ADA Lovelace Institute and the UK AI Council](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Legal-mechanisms-for-data-stewardship_report_Ada_AI-Council-2.pdf), the data steward’s role is to “oversee data processing, make decisions and grant access according to terms, enforce compliance of agreed terms, facilitate the exercise of rights by individuals, and ensure that data providers and data users have adequate remedies”. For these reasons, it is important that data stewards have a certain level of understanding of the relevant legislation and how to ensure compliance.

### Research Data Management

It goes without saying that a significant aspect of a data steward’s work is Research Data Management or RDM. The largest portion of the legal framework that concerns a Data Stewart refers to RDM. RDM is a long-term process, which is based on systematic work with scientific groups, explaining the benefits, but the fundamental thing is to change the mindset of the scientists themselves. RDM was and still is, in some cases, perceived as "extra work" or even a bothersome activity. Attempts to enforce the measures at institutional levels did not work either, because the members of the academic senates of universities are the scientists who should be directly affected by this. Here, at the same level, the long-term activity of the ELIXIR research infrastructure towards the Ministry of Education and other stakeholders, heads of grant agencies and providers, who, after very intensive negotiations, began to implement the requirement for RDM into grant tender documents and calls, worked.

When the requirement for RDM became an official part of the mandatory parts of project calls, i.e., part of the legal requirements of grant texts, and the so-called top-bottom approach was implemented on the national level, the legal framework for data management began to be gradually set at institutional levels, including the introduction of institutional positions such as "Open Data Managers". And in order to implement the above, policies and legal frameworks must be prepared at the institutional level, based on valid national and international legislation in this area.

In general, a data steward’s tasks do not cover the legal section per se. Most of this work should be covered by the legal department of your organisation. However, a data steward should be knowledgeable about the general knowledge and procedures, so he/she/they know what the basic requirements are to handle the situation and when to contact the lawyers. Building strong connections with the legal departments where they exist is essential to foster collaboration, knowledge sharing, and professional growth within this field. 

This chapter does not detail all the legislation and policies that may apply, as that will differ across nodes and state lines, but it outlines important considerations and guidelines on how to evaluate the circumstances and potential for improvements by providing examples, tips and tricks,  and good practice instances. This chapter explores the importance of how we handle the research data (abiding by the laws, regulations, policies and agreements). In addition, it showcases different levels of legal framework and how to improve your situation. 

Last but not least, Data Stewards in terms of legal framework should be in close collaboration with institutional DPOs and the legal team. The data management and handling should be made in accordance with the FAIR principles, compliance with applicable legislation must be ensured and, taking into account the type and nature of the data, any data compromise in the form of misuse, modification or loss must be actively prevented (including by using available IT security means). 

## Guidelines
The following cheats might help you to get your own legal framework going or improve the already in place system. It is understandable, if you have a specific legal department, that you might not be able to change their systems; however, you can improve the knowledge of the researchers about already in-place procedures and how to approach specific people in the legal department regarding different topics.  

### Know your role and tasks as a Data Steward

As a Data Steward, your primary task is to understand the core legal concepts related to Research Data Management (RDM) and to know your specific legal system and its procedures. This understanding enables you to recognise potential legal issues and risks that a project might encounter. It's important to know your limits: you are not expected to be a legal expert or to formalise contracts. Instead, you should be able to identify legal challenges a project might face. When you spot a potential problem or require formal legal advice, your responsibility is to promptly consult the research team, clearly explain your concerns, and then refer them to the organisation’s Legal Department or the Data Protection Officer (DPO) for expert guidance. In essence, you serve as the vital first line of defence and a key facilitator, effectively bridging the gap between research practices and legal compliance.
