Service Overview:

As part of its commitment to enabling secure, FAIR, and legally compliant research, ELIXIR-FI supports researchers working with sensitive data through the national research IT infrastructure provider, CSC. CSC provides a robust suite of services and guidance specifically designed to manage personal, sensitive, and regulated data (including data falling under GDPR, medical confidentiality rules, or national legislation).
