## What this indicator measures
This indicator assesses whether researchers can easily find, understand, and rely on written RDM guidance. It considers the visibility, clarity, maintenance, and communication of materials such as policies, DMP templates, metadata standards, file naming conventions, and consent procedures. The focus is not on service provision and supporting infrastructure, or communication and responsiveness, but on whether guidance is available, usable, and discoverable without having to ask.

## Maturity levels

### Level 1 – None
* No written RDM guidance is available or findable.
* No central location or links to external resources.
* No templates, examples, or practical instructions.
* Researchers rely entirely on informal, ad hoc support.
* Impact: Researchers work without clear direction, leading to inconsistent practice, duplicated effort, and non-compliance.

### Level 2 – Unclear and hard to find
* Guidance exists but is scattered across multiple locations.
* Materials are outdated or incomplete.
* No clear responsibility for updates or quality.
* Coverage is limited to a few topics, often in inaccessible language.
* Impact: Resources are underused or distrusted, and staff time is wasted answering avoidable questions.

### Level 3 – Partially available
* A central entry point exists, covering some key RDM topics.
* Updates happen occasionally but without a fixed schedule.
* Coverage is uneven, with some topics missing or underdeveloped.
* Guidance is sometimes referenced in training or onboarding.
* Impact: Researchers can find some guidance, but gaps and irregular updates limit trust and uptake.

### Level 4 – Clearly visible and maintained
* A single, well-structured platform covers the full research lifecycle.
* Guidance is regularly updated, timestamped, and versioned.
* Information is actively promoted through multiple channels.
* Linked from library, ethics, IT, and research portals for maximum visibility.
* Impact: Researchers encounter trusted, current guidance early and often, reducing reliance on ad hoc support and enabling consistent good practice.
