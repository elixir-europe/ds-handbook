# Data Steward Handbook
Last updated: [3 December, 2024]

Welcome to the Data Steward Handbook, an [ELIXIR Research Data Management (RDM) Community](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/research-data-management) resource that offers practical guidance to data stewards on relevant topics in their daily job, encouraging the use of existing resources and best practices to improve local data management.

## Why a Data Steward Handbook?

* In many organisations the data steward position is a new, often solo activity. Beyond the silos of local organisations and from the perspective of data stewards’ experiences, this Handbook aims to make their knowledge more accessible.

* A Data Steward Handbook was raised by the community as a missing element in the RDM ecosystem. In contrast to other resources that provide guidelines and best practices, the Data Steward Handbook provides examples on how to actually perform your tasks. 

## Target audience 

Data stewards dealing with life science data, regardless of their level of proficiency. 

Note: some people may not have “data steward” as their job title, but are still responsible for support in data management, curation and coordinating. For a definition of this role, see the [RDMkit Data Steward page](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/data_steward).

## Goals

* To offer practical guidance to data stewards on relevant topics in their daily job.
* To facilitate knowledge exchange on implementing good data management practices. 

## Out of scope

* The handbook does not provide legal advice and users must assess if its content is applicable to their institution, ELIXIR node, and/or country. 
* The handbook does not address how an individual can manage their own research data nor is it a registry of resources (training materials, tools, standards etc.) as this is addressed by other ELIXIR resources such as [RDMkit](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/), [DSW](https://ds-wizard.org/), [FAIR Cookbook](https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/content/home.html), [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/) and [TeSS](https://tess.elixir-europe.org/).

## What to get out of this Handbook

* Real-world examples of how other data stewards run data management activities in their institute, with tips and ideas that help others.
* Existing data management know-how, as well as exchange on the practical implementation of these in a specific institute as a best practice. 
* Good practices in training and community building, to stimulate data stewardship skills, local peer-to-peer learning and knowledge sharing in your institute.
* Information on how to assess data management practices and apply these assessments to (further) develop your institute’s data management strategy.
* Guidelines around data steward competencies, job profiles and career paths.
* Link lists (i.e., where to find all the resources)
